* EncryptionService

This service should use a Java library with an static method.

The static method returns the encrypted array but can also throw some runtime exception.

We need to implement an algebra that call to this method but lifting the exceptions into the `F` context.

This is the signature of the Java method:

```com.sample.encryption.Encryptor.encryptString(s: String): Array[Byte]```

* HTTPService

The company already has a HTTPClient for interacting with their API. We need to add a log call before and after the call.

We need to implement the algebra through a builder receiving the HTTPClient. It looks like the following:

```
class SampleClient[F[_]: Async] {
  def loadInfoRequest(id: UUID, prefs: Preferences): F[UserInformation]
}
```

* ValidationService

We need to add an implementation for this algebra. It needs to validate the following things:

 * The age should be >= 18.
 * The gender need to be `M` (Male) or `F` (Female)
 * The heightAndWeight comes in the form: 175x80 (cm and kg). We need to split the value and put in two int fields.

The errors need to be accumulated in a NonEmptyList but we donâ€™t give details about what were the original values, we need to log them as errors.

* Logging

We can use `org.slf4j` for logging but we should treat the logger build and the logging message as a side effect.
